In this file, we will experiment with creating dynamic/ animated weather maps for the state of Connecticut using weather data we retrieved and cleaned from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting.

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# Package Import:

import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import 

# Data Connection:

    # Shapefile import:

shapefile_path = "../data/grid_cell_shapefile/grid_cells.shp"

    # Dataframe with weather data folder import:

csv_folder_path = 'path_to_your_csv_folder'
weather_data_gdfs = []

```

Before we begin mapping, we have to unify the data we have about the weather trends with the shapefiles we have created for the grid cells which cover the state of Connecticut. 

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true



```

Now, we can move onto mapping and building our animation!

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true



```
