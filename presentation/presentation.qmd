## Prediction & Prevention

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::: {.column1 style="padding-right: 180px;"}

Weather data analysis involves statistical data science skills:

- Extreme Value Analysis
- Visualization
- Big Data Processing

# Sourcing Weather Data

---

## European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts

Widely used for academic studies in weather, hydrogology, and climatology research

More options:

- National Weather Service, 
- NASA, or 
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## ECMWF

## A New File Type: "*.GRIB*"

The GRIB data type:

- Has existed in various iterations since 1985
- Built for regular updating & dissemination for weather data
- **GRI**dded **B**inary 
    - "Low storage"
    - Independent grid cell composition

---

## Cleaning *.GRIB* Files

Peculiarities of *.GRIB* file processing:

- Published as single files for any number of grid cells for set time interval
- You may want the format as individual grid cells for a complete time series
- Import of *.GRIB* is very finnicky in Python

## Cleaning *.GRIB* Files

```{python}
#| eval: false

```

## GIS Skills: Cartography



Most default Python visualizations do not include cartographic information:

## GIS Skills: Coordinate Projections

::::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::: {.column1}

::: {.section1}

**Geographic Coordinate Systems**

Describe points in terms of longitude and latitude, on the spherical surface of Earth

The most common datum is the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84).

The EPSG:4326 code is used as a python argument.

::: {.section3}

**Projected Coordinate Systems**

Describe points in terms of cartesian coordinates. Must use tailor-fit PCS for your ROI.
